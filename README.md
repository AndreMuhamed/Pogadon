# Start of Discord bot development.

Here we prepared you to write Discord bot. What you need to know, what you need to download, everything is in this spirit.

To create a Discord bot in Python, you need to install Python, the discord.py library, and any text editor or integrated development environment (IDE).

1. Python can be downloaded from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

2. You can use any text editor or IDE to create Python code. Some of the most popular options:

Visual Studio Code (https://code.visualstudio.com/)
PyCharm (https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)
Sublime Text (https://www.sublimetext.com/)
It is important to note that it is not necessary to use an IDE, but it can facilitate the process of developing and debugging the code.

3. Some additional tools may be useful, for example, Git (https://git-scm.com/) for version control and source code management, as well as the Discord Developer Portal (https://discord.com/developers/applications/ ) to create and configure your Discord app and bot.

4. Install the required Python libraries, such as discord.py, using the pip package manager. For example, type the following command in a terminal to install discord.py:

Copy code
pip install discord.py

5. Create a new Python file and import the discord.py library:

Copy code
import discord

6. Create a Discord client object that will be used to communicate with the Discord API:

Copy code
client = discord.Client()

7. Create a function that will be called when the bot is ready for use:

Copy code
@client.event
async def on_ready():
     print('Bot is ready.')
    
8. Start the bot using the authorization token you received in step 1:

Copy code
client.run('your_token_here')

9. Now you can add your own commands and functionality to your bot using various events such as on_message, on_member_join, on_member_remove, etc.
For example, to add a command that greets a user when they type !hello, you can add the following code:

Copy code
@client.event
async def on_message(message):
     if message.content.startswith('!hello'):
         await message.channel.send('Hello!')
        
This is just a small example of how to start creating a Discord bot in Python. For more information, visit the discord.py official documentation.
